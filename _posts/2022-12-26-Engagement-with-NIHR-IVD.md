We are delighted to announce that we have engaged with NIHR London In Vitro Diagnostics Co-operative (“London IVD”). 

We will ask healthcare professionals and experts at the London IVD for help with ensuring the device fits into existing patient care pathways, that its cost effectiveness is optimised for deployment into the NHS, that is tested against human factor and 
optimising the pathway to NHS adoption.
